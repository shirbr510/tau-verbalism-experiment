## Isn't this super simple?
a friend of mine is carrying an experiment and all the solutions she knows insist on google forms
by using pure HTML & js, the solution is agnostic to websites :)

## What about dependencies?
as long as you run this in a browser, NONE!
this code is super simple and doesn't depend on ES6, module, or anything like that
